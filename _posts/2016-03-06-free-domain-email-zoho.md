## Why obtain a domain email?

Website owners do not give much importance to owning a domain level email even though a free domain email can be created easily. This is true in the case of many beginners and it was true in my case as well. I used to have a gmail account for all the email communications and form pages.

In a way, it was easy to handle all the emails from one place but my inbox started to clutter with spam. It is a headache to cleanup inbox every time I was bombarded with spam emails.

Another thing that matters is credibility. Let's say you have a domain called ```truejewels.in``` where you sell jewelery online and you are using an email, ```john321@gmail.com``` along with it. When you send an email to a customer about the confirmation of an order with this email id, do you think they trust you that you are from **Truejewels**?

What if your email id was ```john@truejewels.in```? That gives the customer an affirmation that you really are associated with **Truejewels**. I'm going to give you a tutorial where you can get a free custom domain email by ZOHO. You will get a fully functional email setup.

The best part about ZOHO mail is that you don't always have to login to the mailbox to check the mail. You can simply setup forward for your mails in custom domain email to get them in your personal email.

## How to set up a free domain email?

Since we are using ZOHO for setting up a free custom email, it is necessary to have an account in ZOHO. While you [sign up with ZOHO](https://www.zoho.com/signup.html){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"} use a gmail account if you have one. I will explain why in the tips section.

### Step 1: Log in to ZOHO
After signing up and verifying the email they send, go to [ZOHO home page](https://home.zoho.com/home){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"} and click on **mail**.

Select the **LITE** plan by clicking on **Choose** button below it.

### Step 3: Add Domain
Enter the domain you own in the input field where it says **Add Domain**.

### Step 4: Confirm Details
You will be redirected to **Confirm Details** page where you have to click on **Setup yourdomain.com in ZOHO**

### Step 5:
This is the crucial part where you have to verify your ownership for the domain. Select your domain registrar from the drop-down menu. If you don't see your registrar in the list, then select others.

### Step 6:
Once you select your option (in my case it was **others**) you should see a table with **Name** and **Destination**.
![free email hosting for domain](/images/setup-custom-domain-email-with-ZOHO-6.jpg)
<div id="step7"></div>
&nbsp;

### Step 7:
Now in a new tab log in to your registrar (in my case godaddy), navigate to add a CNAME with the Name value which is similar to
<pre>zb14572708</pre>
and Host value
<pre>zmverify.zoho.com</pre>
, click Finish.

Finally click on **Save changes**. Do not close the window yet, we need it for <a href="#step9">Step 9</a>

### Step 8:
Now come back to the **ZOHO Domain Setup** tab and click on the **Verify CNAME** button which will be at the bottom of the page. If not successful then give it some time. You should see the below message once you successfully verify your domain.

<div id="step9"></div>
&nbsp;

### Step 9:
You are not done yet. Once you choose a ```username```, skip to **Configure Email Delivery**. You should see a table with MX records.
![free email hosting for domain setup ZOHO godaddy](/images/setup-custom-domain-email-with-ZOHO-10.jpg)
{% include adsense-inside-post.html %}
Now we have to enter these **Mail Exchange** records in our registrar. Use the same procedure as you did in <a href="#step7">Step 7</a> but this time, select Add record &gt;&gt; MX. There are two records to be added. That is for redundancy I guess.

### Step 10:
You are good to access your emails in [ZOHO mail](https://mail.zoho.com/){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}. You can send and receive mails to this mailbox. Check if it is working by sending a mail from a different email account and once you receive it, reply to the mail. If everything is working fine then go to the next step.

### Final step ( I swear)
It is hard to always login to ZOHO mail and check for mails. A better way is to get the mails received by ZOHO to your personal mail. This is pretty easy. Once you login to ZOHO mailbox, click on gear icon at the top-right corner. Then click on settings.

Carefully look for **Email forwarding and POP/IMAP** and click on it. It will open up [email forwarding](https://mail.zoho.com/mail/zmset.do#12){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"} page.

Now add your personal email and verify with the email they send to your personal email. Now you are done with ZOHO email setup!

Only one free domain email can be set up with ZOHO. What if you own many domains? Well, you can take a glance at **Tips** but I don't recommend it.
<div class="tips">
<h3>Tips</h3>
What if you want custom email for multiple domains? If you sign up to ZOHO with a gmail id say, john@gmail.com then you can also sign up for another account with j.ohn@gmail.com. Because Google considers both the addresses to be the same but not ZOHO! So with one gmail account, you can sign up many accounts! Thank me later
