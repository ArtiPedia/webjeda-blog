I have started teaching how to make websites for budding web designers. I have posted the playlist here. Take a look. I have started off with teaching 'hosting websites on Github'. The best thing about Github is that it hosts your website (only static) rightaway. This is the simplest way to learn web designing. 

##Why teach Github?
While I was learning, I used to go through YouTube videos. But there was not a single guy who teaches it without using CLI. When you run commands on CLI, it will not output the same result for everyone. It depends on the previous installations and a correct PATH variable. For starters CLI is a hard nut to crack. So I decided to make it easier for beginners. I used no CLI in my videos. Everything was done through GUI.

I got a very positive response for my efforts. A few in the screenshots below

There are other tools I recommend for web designers 

[Brackets](http://brackets.io) - an awesome code editor. (recommended plugin - [emmet](http://emmet.io/download/))

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - to sync files with your repository.

[Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - for its 'inspect' feature and JavaScipt v8 engine.

[w3schools](www.w3schools.com/) - they are the best at teaching how to code.

I think Github pages is faster than any other conventional web hosting method. Github cannot execute files in the server. So php files will not run in Github. If you are looking for inserting a contact form in Github pages, you may have to struggle a little bit.
I have a solutio for [creating working forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP6HsgwQkvs).

Only after making hundreds of mistakes, one can learn the best way to code a website.

Jekyll is another boon to web designers to host their blogs or single page websites. I have created many blogs on jekyll. It almost will never break. Uptime of the websites depends on Github. As an established company, Github is always up and running. I have not faced any major issues with them. I think years ago my blog was down for few seconds.

Finally what I suggest for new developers is to get familiar with Github and contribute to the community. Thank me later.
