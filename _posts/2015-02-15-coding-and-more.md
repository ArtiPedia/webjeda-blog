I have started teaching how to make websites for budding web designers. I have posted the playlist here. Take a look. I have started off with teaching 'hosting websites on Github'. The best thing about Github is that it hosts your website (only static) rightaway. This is the simplest way to learn web designing. 

There are other tools I recommend for web designers 

[Brackets](http://brackets.io) - an awesome code editor. (recommended plugin - [emmet](http://emmet.io/download/))

[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - to sync files with your repository.

[Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - for its 'inspect' feature and JavaScipt v8 engine.

[w3schools](www.w3schools.com/) - they are the best at teaching how to code.

I think Github pages is faster than any other conventional web hosting methods. Github cannot execute files in the server. So php files will not run in Github. If you are looking for inserting a contact form in Github pages, you may have to struggle a little bit.

Only after making hundreds of mistakes, one can learn the best way to code a website.

Jekyll is another boon to web designers to host their blogs or single page websites. I have created many blogs on jekyll. It almost will never break. Uptime of the websites depends on Github. As an established company, Github is always up and running. I have not faced any major issues with them. I think years ago my blog was down for few seconds.

Finally what I suggest for new developers is to get familiar with Github and contribute to the community. Thank me later.
