I have been using Github pages since 2012. It was a hardnut for me when I started but eventually I understood it is based on a few simple logics. I always wondered how people create such wonderful websites and blogs that loads so quick! All the blogs hosted on Github Pages using Jekyll has this modern look that can only be generated by a UI expert. I love simple and good design. This was the first thing that got me into Github.

##Why github pages

###1. It is free:
This is something I found out really late. By that time I had a hosting space bought from hostgator :(


###2. It is fast:
Github Pages are incredibly fast when compared to WordPress and other CMSs.


###3. It is secure:
There is no backend execution in Github pages and the chances of website getting hacked are nil(one of the reasons why [Obama campaign](https://contribute.barackobama.com/) used Jekyll)


###4. Blog aware:
Jekyll is a static website generator used for blogging in Github pages. Jekyll blogs will have almost all the features of a general blog.


These are some of the major advantages over other platforms, you'll realize more perks when you start using it. So let's start by creating a simple website.

##Step 1: Create a repository

I hope you have signed up for Github, otherwise you can [sign up for free here](https://github.com). Once you have signed up you have to create a repository by clicking on the **+** symbol on the top-right corner as shown in the screenshot.

Name it whatever you feel like. I'm naming it **test**. Also check **Initialize this repository with a README** as we get a README file inside our repository to start with.

Once you are done creating a repository, you should be able to see a README file inside your repository.

##Step 2: Create gh-pages branch

Your repository will have a master branch in default. You should create a branch named **gh-pages** in order to host your files. To create the branch, click on downward arrow next to the master branch which is a drop-down button. You have to type gh-pages inside the input field and hit enter.

##Step3: Create simple html file

Inside gh-pages branch you should create a HTML file which has some visible elements in it. I am going to create a file named **index.html** and have a background color and a h1 tag. Use **New File** button to create a new file and name it index.html.

Copy this code inside the index.html file if you are a lazy developer like I am and hit the **Commit** button. (commit is nothing but an enter button!)

{% highlight html linenos %}


<html>
 
  <title>First website</title>
  
   <body>
    
    <h1>This is my first github page</h1>
  
  </body>
  
      <style>
            body {
              background-color:green;
              color:#fff;
              text-align:center;
            }
      </style>
  
</html>

{% endhighlight %}



##Step 4: That's all! 

Now to see whether your website is hosted, click on **Settings** tab and see if you have a green check mark in **Github Pages** section with a URL next to it as shown in the screenshot.

Now click on the URL and you should see your website hosted!

And success! 

This is just a single file website. If you want to sync a lot of folders, files, images etc., then you may have to use a Github Client like Github Desktop or SourceTree(my favourite) to push the files.

Don't forget to post the link of your website created on Github Pages. And ask me if you are stuck in any of the steps above.
