While I was working at Cognizant Technology Solutions I always used to have a tab open on my internet browser - [github.com](https://github.com){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}. Cognizant has a learning period of two months in which I googled a lot about it. I was wondered by the contributions people do there. People were creating cool plugins, websites, providing information, documentations and step by step guide for coders.

By then I was learning HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript. I used to implement the code I learned into **Github Pages** to see how it comes out. It was not always a positive result. I had to debug a lot and adapt the code rather copy pasting it. 

Initially I had to design a website for my friend. It was supposed to have all the details of her company, contact information and frequent updating of tournament results. It is actually a website on on-line chess coaching business. Initially I created a website using **Adobe Muse** - which is a non-coders best friend. It was all good but I had a problem hosting it. I tried a free service called [vlexo](http://vlexofree.com/){:rel='nofollow'}. It was good for a free service but it asked us to put a link back of their website in my website. So I was looking for an alternative. 

I used to see many **.io** websites with a lot of content in it but even then they load superfast! I was curious to know how they do it. After some research I found out that they are hosted on Github Pages or Amazon s3. So I chose Github Pages (which is free) to host my website. It was all good but when it came to forms, I did not know how to [make a form for static website](http://blog.webjeda.com/how-to-add-form-option-to-jekyll-websites){:target="_blank"}. As a business we had new parents writing to us through our website form asking about the details. So I moved it to WordPress. It is still in WordPress - [inapurichessworld](http://inapurichessworld.com)

But by this time I had a good hang of Github and started hosting my websites on it.

I created few websites like


[RedGadgets](http://redgadget.github.io/){:rel='nofollow'}

[Dxartist](http://dxartist.github.io/){:rel='nofollow'}

[c10h14n2](http://c10h14n2movie.com){:rel='nofollow'}

They are old and discontinued but I had a good learning through these websites. I kept them in the repository as a memory. 


I realized (very late though) that web designing is my passion. I kept on learning more about html5. I also started learning Android application development. I never thought I can make it a business but I fully enjoyed making modern websites.

Learning was always there. Even now for a web designer it is hard to figure out how to use github for his/her development. I learned Github through many tutorials and I still feel there is a lot to learn. I will tell you all about it in the next post .
