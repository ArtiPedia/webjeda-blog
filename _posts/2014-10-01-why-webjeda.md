While I was working at Cognizant Technology Solutions I always used to have a tab open on my internet browser which was github.com. Cognizant had learning period of two months in which I googled a lot about it. I was wondered by the contributions people do there. People were creating cool plugins, websites, providing information, documentations and steb by step guide for coders.

By then I was learning html, css and a little javascript. I used to implement the code I learned in Github Pages to see how it comes up. It was not always a positive result. I had to debug a lot and adapt the code rather copy pasting it. 

I created few websites like


[RedGadgets](http://redgadget.github.io/)

[Dxartist](http://dxartist.github.io/)

[c10h14n2](http://c10h14n2movie.com)

They are old but I had a good learning through those websites. I kept them in the repository just as a memory.


I realized (very late though) that web designing is my passion. I kept on learning more about html5. I also started learning Android application development. I never thought I can make it a business but I fully enjoyed making modern websites.

Learning was always there. Even now for a web designer it is hard to figure out how to use github for his/her development. I learned Github through many tutorials and I still feel there is a lot to learn. In the next post I will tell you all about it.
