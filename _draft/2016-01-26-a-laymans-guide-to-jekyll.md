Jekyll was easy in the beginning. Because I was just adding posts or editing the current ones. But when I had to change the font or color I had to go throught the css and make changes accordingly. Even this wasn't hard. But if I wanted a new page, a new functionality like adding tags, related posts, share buttons, author box etc., I had no idea how to do it. 

##Why learn Jekyll the right way

When I had to make some changes in Jekyll, I used to write dirty codes in the template and somehow make it work for a while but if I wanted to make any changes to then I have to search for the code, see how it used to work, edit or add some more dirty code and make it work. This was what I used to do years ago. Half knowledge is worse than no knowledge is true in the case of Jekyll blogs.

These dirty codes would break my site sometimes leading to undesirable results. Sometimes I wouldn't know what exactly went wrong. I never used to add comments while commiting the changes (big mistake). I can revert back though but I would lose all the changes and posts :(

##Doing it the right way
Read the [documentation provided by Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/){:rel='nofollow'}{:target="_blank"}. This will set you on the right path. It has a lot of information and lot of pages as well. So I thought I would summarise it in this post so that anyone could make use of it.
