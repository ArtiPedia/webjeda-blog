There was not a convenient way to minify the whole Jekyll blog html untill I found this cool ```html``` file which does the minifying like a champ. And it doesn't need any coding from your end. Something like a plug and play.

## Why do we have to minify HTML?

Speed is a factor to rank high in google search page. Minifying HTML can lead to a increase in around 5% speed. Lighter the website easier to load even on a slow connection. Usual html file consists of a lot of empty spaces. Sometimes you will have comments in between {% raw %}<!-- and -->{% endraw %}, new lines, blank spaces etc., It is good to keep what really matters and omit the rest.

Though minifying CSS and JS is largely practiced, minifying HTML is not given such an importance. May be because there is not much to minify compared to CSS and JS. But it does help loading your website at a better speed even on 2G connections. Moreover, PageSpeed recomends minifying HTML.

I have seen huge benefits by minifying my Jekyll blog. What if I tell you that minifying reduces the file size more than 50%! May be because I have a lot of blank spaces and new lines in the unminifies version.
